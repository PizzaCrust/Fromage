# Fromage
Fromage allows developers to quickly create Sponge plugins quickly using the Lua scripting language.

### Features

- Easy deployment into Sponge, simply do /envreload and the environment reloads!
- Easy language to learn, API names directly use Java names; so no more naming confusion!
- Fromage is very extensible and has a low-level API to access unsupported items.
